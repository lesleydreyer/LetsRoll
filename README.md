Let's Roll
An app to schedule board game sessions. Currently it only allows users to sign up, log in, log out, view/create/edit/delete game events. Eventually I would like to add on the ability to register for a game, add comments, to a game, sort/search/filter while viewing games, and connect to the board game geek api to show game info. Also plan to improve the CSS to better match the mockups below.
