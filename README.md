# Let's Roll
An app to schedule board game sessions. Currently it only allows users to sign up, log in, log out, view and create game events, and edit and delete game events in which the user created. Eventually I would like to add on the ability to register for a game, add comments, to sort/search/filter while viewing games, connect to the board game geek api to show game info, and improve the CSS to better match the mockups below.
